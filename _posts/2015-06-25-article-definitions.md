#Class
A class is the blueprint for how individual objects should be made. An example would be if we had a class called Song. The attributes for this class would be artist, song name, genere and duration. Each individual object of the Song class would have an artist, a song name, a genere and a duration. 

#Model
A model is a class that is connected to a database. 

#Method
A method is a block of code that returns a value. We use methods for when we need to run the same code many times in a program. Methods belong to a class and can be used on a class object. 

Example of a method:
```ruby
def hello
  puts "Hello! I am a method"
end
```
#Variable
A variable is something that stores data. The data can be a variety of types such as: integer, string, etc. Variables are assigned individual names and they hold specific objects. For example: name = Cameron. Name is the variable name and Cameron is the object that it is refering to.
